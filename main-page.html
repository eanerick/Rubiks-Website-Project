            </h2>
            <p id="first-paragraph">This method involves memorizing 7 different algorithms. 
                This is the best place to start because it allows you to see the Rubik's cube in it's fundamental parts.
                You basically look at the Rubik's cube as the 3 separate layers; top, bottom, and middle. 
                In the bottom layer, you will create a white cross and then solve the corners. In the middle layer, 
                you will solve the edges. With the top layer, you will solve the cross, the edges, then the corners, and finally you will orient the 
                corners to solve the cube.

            <h2 id="third-h2-header">Here are the Steps</h2>
            <p id="third-paragraph">
                <h3>Solve the White Cross:</h3>
                For this step, you can solve without needing to know any algorithms. The most important part to this step is to match 
                both edge colors with their center pieces.
                <h3>Solve the First Layer Corners:</h3>
                For this step, you will use this algorithm; R' D' R D.  To use this algorithm, you will need to position the corner piece on the 
                bottom layer beneath where you want the piece to go. You need to do this algorithm once if the white is facing right, three times when it is facing down, and 
                five times if it is facing forward.
                <h3>Solve the Second Layer:</h3>
                For this step, you will use these algorithms; U R U' R' U' F' U F | U' L' U L U F U' F'. 
                You will have to position the piece in the center on the top layer with the forward facing colors matching. You will need to use the 
                first algorithm if you need to move the piece to the right and the second algorithm if you need to move the piece to the left.<br>
                <h3>Solve the Top Layer Cross:</h3>
                If you have a backwards L, you will need to use the F U R U' R' F' algorithm. You will need to position the backwards L in the back left 
                corner. If you have a line of yellow, you will need to use the F R U R' U' F' algorithm. The line will have to be positioned horizontally.<br>
                <h3>Solve the Top Layer Edges:</h3>
                For this step, you will need to use the algorithm U R U R' U R U2 R'. If the edges that need to be swapped are positioned next to each other, do 
                this algorithm once. If they are positioned opposite one another, perform this algorithm twice.<br>
                <h3>Solve the Top Layer Corners:</h3>
                For this step, you will need to use this algorithm U R U' L' U R' U' L. You will need to position the corner that is in the correct position 
                in the front right top position and then perform the algorithm once to complete this step. If there is no piece that is placed in the correct
                position, you will need to perform this algorithm once to create a corner that is positioned correctly and then once again to position the rest of the 
                corners correctly.
                <h3>Orienting the Last Layer Corners</h3>
                For the last step, you will use the algorithm (R' D' R D) (R' D' R D). You will need to position your cube so that you have a piece that isn't oriented correctly 
                at the top right corner. If the yellow is facing right, you use the algorithm once. If the piece is facing forward, you use this algorithm twice. After this, you move the top 
                layer over to the right until you find the next piece that is oriented incorrectly. Repeat this step until you solve the cube.
